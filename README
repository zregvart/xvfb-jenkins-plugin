MOVED to jenkins-ci repository at https://github.com/jenkinsci/xvfb-plugin, development continues there.

This is a plugin for Jenkins-CI (http://jenkins-ci.org) that starts Xvfb (http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) with the start of the job, and stops it when the job is done.
